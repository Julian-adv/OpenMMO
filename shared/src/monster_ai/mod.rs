//! Monster behavior trees, ticked and applied by the server.

//! The module is split into:
//! - [`tree`] — behavior tree data model and JSON loading
//! - [`command`] — AI state and behavior input/output types
//! - [`path`] — pathfinding abstraction ([`PathProvider`])
//! - [`brain`] — the per-monster [`MonsterBrain`] (struct, tick, event handlers)
//! - [`behavior`] — behavior tree execution (condition/action evaluation)
//! - [`movement`] — state transitions and path-following helpers
